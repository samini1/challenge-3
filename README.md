# Password Generator

## Intended functionality

This application should randomly generate a password that provides greater security when the user presses the "Generate" button.

Given a series of prompts, the user should be able to choose the length of their password and customize included character types from a number of criteria including lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special. 

The password should be displayed in the text area of the page after it has been generated.
